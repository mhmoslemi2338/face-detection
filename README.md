In this project we're using HOG feature extractor which means Histogram of oriented gradients , after extracting features we used a polinomial SVM classifier to train a model with train data , after that we save this classifier in a pckl file in hard Disk , then with function FaceDetector in FaceDetector.py we can detect faces in any input images.

some results and charts are also included in this repository.
